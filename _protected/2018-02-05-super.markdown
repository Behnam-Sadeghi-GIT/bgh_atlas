  description: 'This 3D mechanical model explores the dynamics of continental accretion by including a subducting slab, and overriding plate and mantle dynamics. The model displays the following phases: (1) a collisional stage when the microcontinental ribbon initially accretes to the overriding plate; (2) a transitional stage where the convergent subducting plate and trench reorganize through coeval trench advance and retreat in different parts of the boundary; and (3) the re-initiation of a stable subduction system behind the accreted microcontinent.'

  description: 'Initial geometry of the distinct material domains in the numerical model, not to scale. The subducting plate is 100km thick, 3,000kmwide and 7,000kmin length, and is built from 4 layers. The overriding plate has three domains: a back-arc region (1,200 km) a transitional region (350 km) and a continental backstop (750 km), each of which comprises two layers of equal thickness. The indenting ribbon is 50km in thickness, 1,500km wide and 500km deep (perpendicular to the convergence direction). Each of the vertical boundaries is a symmetry plane.'

  description: 'A comparison of velocities during collision, accretion and recovery. Shown are the velocities of the subducting plate (black lines), the retreating end of the plate boundary (‘Trench retreat rate’, green), the colliding end of the plate boundary ‘Trench advance rate’, red), and the cusp of the laterally retreating trench (‘Lateral rollback rate’, blue). Negative velocities indicate retreat, positive velocities indicate advance.'

Homemade Spaghetti Sauce is so full of flavor and it's easy to make it in large batches for freezing or canning for easy homemade meals that are prepared ahead.

Yield: about 8 cups

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large white onion, minced
- 5 cloves garlic, crushed
- ½ cup chicken broth
- 1 (28 ounce can) crushed tomatoes
- 1 (15 oz can) tomato sauce
- 1 (6 ounce can) tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon fennel seeds
- 1 tablespoon ground oregano
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup chopped fresh basil
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions
Heat a large pot on the stove over medium high heat. Add in olive oil and saute onion in the olive oil for about 5 minutes, until softened. Add in 5 cloves and saute another 30-60 seconds.

Pour in chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, fennel, oregano, salt, pepper, basil, and parsley. Bring to a simmer.

Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1-4 hours. Use an immersion blender to puree the mixture until the desired consistency is achieved, leaving it slightly chunky, or making it completely smooth.

## Notes
This recipe can be used in canning.

For easy long term storage, cool and then place into several gallon sized resealable freezer bags. Lay flat on a pan and place in the freezer until solid. Thaw and reheat in the microwave or on the stove to serve.
